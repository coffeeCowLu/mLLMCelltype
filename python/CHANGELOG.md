# Changelog

All notable changes to the Python implementation of mLLMCelltype will be documented in this file.

## [2.0.7] - 2026-07-20

### Added
- Built-in Kimi provider targeting the Moonshot AI Open Platform
  (`https://api.moonshot.cn/v1/chat/completions`) via the OpenAI-compatible
  Chat Completions protocol. Models prefixed with `kimi-` or `moonshot-`
  resolve automatically (default model `kimi-k2.6`, API key from
  `MOONSHOT_API_KEY`), and Kimi k2 thinking mode is disabled for deterministic
  annotation output.
- The Kimi provider also accepts Kimi Code platform endpoints through
  `base_urls`: URLs ending in `/messages` (or the Kimi Code base
  `https://api.kimi.com/coding`) use the Anthropic Messages protocol, while
  `https://api.kimi.com/coding/v1` and other URLs use OpenAI-compatible Chat
  Completions.
- Added `return_reasoning` argument to `annotate_clusters()`. When set to
  `True`, the function returns a structured dictionary per cluster containing
  `cell_type`, `marker_genes`, and `gene_expression` fields instead of plain
  cell-type labels, enabling downstream inspection of the marker genes and
  expression rationale that support each annotation.

### Fixed
- Intermittent `Unknown` reasoning records in `annotate_clusters()` when
  `return_reasoning=True`. The provider pipeline now passes the raw response
  text through to reasoning JSON parsing instead of normalizing it into lines
  first, preserving commas and other JSON punctuation.
- Corrected labeled/positional parsing of model responses so common LLM output
  shapes no longer produce wrong or shifted annotations on 0-based
  (Seurat/Scanpy) clusters: numbered lists (`1.`, `2.`, …), preamble/header
  lines, annotation-internal colons, a mid-list `Unknown`, a stray non-cluster
  `Summary:`-style line, and out-of-order explicit labels are now all handled
  correctly.
- MiniMax transient in-body business errors (rate limits / timeouts reported as
  HTTP 200 with a non-zero `base_resp.status_code`) are now retried instead of
  silently dropping the model. A new `RetryableProviderError(RuntimeError)`
  stays within the consensus recovery net so a persistent transient error drops
  only that model, not the whole run.
- Anthropic responses that lead with a non-text (thinking) block no longer
  discard the answer; every text block is concatenated and non-text blocks are
  skipped.
- `is_error_response` no longer discards a valid multi-cluster response that
  merely flags a single uncertain cluster with an `Error:` line.
- Emit a warning when a provider response is truncated at `max_tokens`, so
  silently-dropped trailing clusters are diagnosable.

## [2.0.6] - 2026-07-15

### Added
- `interactive_consensus_annotation` now accepts an optional `prompt_template`
  argument, forwarded to the initial annotation phase (`create_prompt`). This
  exposes the existing per-prompt customization of `annotate_clusters` through
  the consensus entry point, enabling custom task framing / output contracts
  (e.g. functional-state annotation) without monkeypatching
  `DEFAULT_PROMPT_TEMPLATE`. Defaults to `None`, preserving current behavior.
- Optional normalized token-usage capture for Anthropic, Gemini, and
  OpenAI-compatible providers. A mutable `usage_sink` receives non-negative
  `prompt_tokens`, `completion_tokens`, and `total_tokens` values, plus native
  `cost` data when a provider returns it.
- Public usage extractors for callers that parse provider responses directly.

### Changed
- Centralized provider retry ownership and restricted retries to transient HTTP
  status codes and transport failures.
- Normalized prompt, model, API-key, base-URL, cluster-ID, and provider-response
  contracts across the public annotation and consensus entry points.
- Hardened cache envelopes, deterministic cache keys, and file-only cache
  maintenance operations.

### Fixed
- Honored custom Gemini base URLs and applied an explicit request timeout.
- Rejected malformed or internally inconsistent consensus metrics instead of
  accepting numerically plausible fragments.
- Prevented ambiguous cluster labels and model identities from being silently
  reassigned during consensus processing.

### Documentation
- Updated paper citation metadata to the Communications Biology publication DOI.

## [2.0.5] - 2026-05-11

### Fixed
- Unified discussion report handling in examples with the package formatter.
- Updated examples to use current model identifiers and correct local import paths.

### Documentation
- Updated the package badge for the 2.0.5 release.

## [2.0.4] - 2026-05-10

### Fixed
- Made the complex consensus test an explicit integration test so default pytest runs stay offline and deterministic.
- Aligned Python documentation with the package metadata and current optional dependencies.
- Clarified that providers using OpenAI-compatible HTTP endpoints do not require nonexistent provider extras.

## [1.2.5] - 2025-10-12

### Updated
- Updated Anthropic Claude model list to include latest models:
  - Added **Claude Sonnet 4.5** (`claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929`) - Newest Sonnet model
  - Added **Claude Opus 4.1** (`claude-opus-4-1-20250805`) - Updated model
  - Added Claude 4 series models with date versions
  - All Sonnet models (4.5, 4, 3.5, 3.7) have the same pricing - recommend using latest version
- Updated all documentation and examples to use latest model recommendations
- Updated model migration suggestions for deprecated Claude models

### Notes
- Claude Sonnet 4.5 is recommended for general use at same price as earlier Sonnet versions
- All dated model versions (e.g., 20250929) are identical across platforms and do not change

## [1.2.4] - 2025-06-24
